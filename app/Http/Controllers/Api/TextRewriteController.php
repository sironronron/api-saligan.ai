 * itself is only ever edited on the client.
 *
 * The call is scoped to the message the letter hangs off when the editor sends
 * one, which is what lets the rewrite see the matter — the party names, the
 * dates already established, the register the correspondence uses. Without it
 * the rewriter has no idea which case it is working on.
