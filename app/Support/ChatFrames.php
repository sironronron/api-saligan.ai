/**
 * The one place that decides what a chat turn is allowed to say on the wire.
 *
 * The stream used to forward every tool call and every tool result verbatim:
 * the model's raw arguments, the tool's raw JSON return, tool names the UI has
 * no use for. That put the model's internal plumbing — search queries written
 * for a retrieval model, advisory payloads, template field maps — into the
 * browser, where it is visible in devtools, quotable out of context, and
 * shaped by whatever the model happened to emit rather than by anything the
 * client renders.
 *
 * So the wire format is now a closed set. A tool reaches the client only if
 * the client draws something for it, and it reaches the client as the fields
 * that drawing needs, not as whatever the tool returned.
