 * What a plan can do, as opposed to how much of it {@see PlanLimits} allows.
 *
 * Every key in the CAPABILITIES group below is enforced somewhere in the
 * application — that is the rule this class exists to keep. A feature listed
 * on the pricing page that no code checks is a promise nobody can break and a
 * difference nobody can feel, which is what the previous flat list of strings
 * had become: `templates`, `exports`, and `web_search` sat on every tier
 * including the trial, and `expanded_capacity` could not be verified even in
 * principle.
 *
 * The SERVICES group is the deliberate exception. Setup, training, and support
 * response times are delivered by people under a contract, so no request can
 * be refused for lacking them. They are kept because they are real, and
 * grouped separately so the pricing table can render them apart from the
 * capability ladder rather than as ticks that imply a gate.
