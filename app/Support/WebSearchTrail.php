/**
 * Shapes the delegated web search's progress into frames the UI can animate.
 *
 * A grounded search is the longest silent stretch of a chat turn: the model
 * stops producing tokens, a second model goes and reads the web, and until it
 * comes back the user has a spinner and a sentence. The sites being read are
 * the most interesting thing happening in the product at that moment, so they
 * are streamed as they are known and cleared the instant the search ends.
 *
 * These frames are transient by contract. They are not citations — the
 * citation cards are emitted separately and persist on the message — and the
 * client is expected to drop the whole trail on `done`. A site that appears
 * here has been read; only the ones that survive into a citation were used.
