 * passage rewriter in the letter editor. The rewriter was the one doing
 * without: it ran entirely stateless, so "fix the grammar of this clause" was
 * answered by a model that had never seen the matter and could not tell a
 * party's name from a typo.
 *
 * User-supplied fields are wrapped as untrusted data, so any instruction a
 * client wrote into a case description is read as a fact about the matter
 * rather than as a command to the model.
