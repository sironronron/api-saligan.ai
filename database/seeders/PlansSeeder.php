     * The paid ladder, and the reasoning behind every number on it.
     *
     * Three self-serve tiers, priced the way the
     * solo-and-small-firm legal-AI market prices: one seat, one seat with the
     * best model, then a team bundle — with annual at exactly ten months
     * ("two months free") instead of a near-ten figure nobody can reproduce.
     *
     * Tiers sell a monthly AI spend allowance, not a message count: the
     * customer sees one percent meter while the ledger keeps every token (see
     * AiBudget). Message volume is what the allowance buys, and what a turn
     * costs depends on which model writes it — the base model costs roughly
     * half the frontier one at our measured token sizes (see EarningsModel).
     * Standard buys room on the base model; Pro buys the frontier model,
     * deeper retrieval, and scan reading. Firm buys a shared team pool,
     * includes the former Business services, and is available annually.
     *
     * Every tier is capped, never metered: allowances are prepaid and an
     * exhausted allowance refuses the turn rather than growing the bill, so no
     * invoice can surprise anyone. There is no per-message overage by design.
     *
     * Every plan is sized to hold roughly 40% contribution after AI, fees,
     * and an operating reserve. Verify with `artisan costing:earnings` after
     * changing anything here — it costs each tier at the model that tier is
     * served and across every seat its price covers.
